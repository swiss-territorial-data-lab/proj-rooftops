# proj-rooftops


**Data**: This workflow is based on some classified LiDAR point cloud. <br>
**Requirements**:
- There are no hardware or software requirements.
- Everything was tested with Python 3.11
- The necessary libraries can be installed from the file `requirements.txt` (from any other branch, otherwise, just install geopandas, PyYAML and loguru)

The path to the config file is hard-coded at the start of each script.
